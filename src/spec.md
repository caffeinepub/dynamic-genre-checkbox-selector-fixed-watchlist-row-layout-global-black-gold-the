## Summary
**Goal:** Enhance manga card UI with vertical title scrolling animation, rainbow-styled Complete status, repositioned icons, and refined status area layout.

**Planned changes:**
- Implement vertical auto-scroll animation for overflowing manga card titles (bottom-to-top, with hover pause/resume)
- Apply rainbow gradient coloring to 'Complete' status text
- Reposition bookmark icon to top right corner and notes icon to bottom right corner
- Make status area chevron and border invisible by matching background color
- Move status area upward and display centered 'chapters read/available' text underneath

**User-visible outcome:** Users will see manga cards with smooth vertical title scrolling for long titles, visually distinctive rainbow-colored Complete status, reorganized icon placement, and cleaner status area with chapter progress information displayed below.
