# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Update the manga watchlist application with gold and rainbow color styling, and enable inline chapter editing.

**Planned changes:**
- Change all text colors to gold throughout the application (except status field text)
- Change watchlist card outlines to gold by default
- Add rainbow color outline effect on card hover
- Change all icons to gold color (except status-related icons)
- Update filter and search input text to gold color
- Make 'Incomplete' status text turn red when selected
- Fill rating star icons with gold color
- Display rating numbers in rainbow color when rating is 8.0 or higher
- Make chapter progress display clickable for inline editing with backend persistence

**User-visible outcome:** Users will see a gold-themed interface with rainbow hover effects on cards and high ratings, and can edit chapter progress directly from the watchlist by clicking on the chapter numbers.
