An unrelated documentation-style file update describes many features not requested in the BuildRequest.",

      "reason": "Filtering behavior and state exist, and props are wired through the panel, but the diff does not show (due to truncation) that the controls UI actually renders a visible checkbox with the exact label \"Complete only\" in the floating controls/filter panel.",
