REQ-1 is satisfied by adding explicit background and foreground color classes to key layout components and inline styles to index.html. REQ-2 is satisfied by replacing OKLCH with RGB color format in tailwind.config.js and providing RGB fallbacks in index.css with @supports for OKLCH. REQ-3 is satisfied by implementing network-first strategy for CSS files in the service worker and adding cache clearing functionality. No missing requirements or hallucinated features detected.",
