  "summary": "Most frontend UI/layout and global theme changes appear implemented (fixed 900x78 watchlist rows with black+gold glow; cover/title width constraints; alternate titles not shown; global CSS variables set to black backgrounds and gold borders). The dynamic genre checkbox feature is partially evidenced via new hooks and form state/combining logic, but the diff does not show the checkbox list UI rendering and also introduces a backend dependency (actor.getAllEntries) without corresponding backend changes in the provided diff.",

    {
      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "The dialog shows a checkbox list of existing genres derived from the current user’s existing manga entries; checkbox list remains usable when many genres exist (scrollable).",
      "reason": "Although genre derivation hooks and selectedGenres state/combining logic are added, the provided AddMangaDialog diff is truncated before any JSX that would actually render the checkbox list and its scrollable container; additionally, the genre list depends on actor.getAllEntries, but no backend changes are shown to confirm that method exists.",

      "reason": "The BuildRequest explicitly says not to change pagination behavior or page size unless required for the watchlist row layout; the fixed row layout does not inherently require limiting a page’s rendered entries to 30.",
