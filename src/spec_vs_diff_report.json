  "summary": "The diff indicates changes to `MangaCard.tsx`, but the provided evidence is truncated and a modified summary file (`frontend-file-summaries.txt`) suggests the ArrowRight icon was moved down by 10px (not 5px) and other layout shifts were introduced. There is no evidence that `frontend/src/utils/formatChapterNumber.ts` was audited/updated to preserve decimal chapter progress display.",

    {
      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "In `frontend/src/components/manga/MangaCard.tsx`, move the title-cycle ArrowRight icon down by 5px (reduce upward Y-translation by 5px) while keeping gutter layout unchanged and keeping spacer consistent when no alternate titles exist.",
      "reason": "The only explicit evidence about the amount of movement indicates the ArrowRight was moved down by 10px rather than 5px, which does not match the requirement.",
      "evidence": [
        "frontend-file-summaries.txt (describes MangaCard.tsx as 'moved down 10px')"

      "requirement": "Fix chapter progress display to preserve decimal values and audit/update `frontend/src/components/manga/MangaCard.tsx` and `frontend/src/utils/formatChapterNumber.ts` to ensure no rounding/truncation in displayed output.",
      "reason": "`frontend/src/utils/formatChapterNumber.ts` is not shown as modified in the diff summary, so there is no evidence the formatter was audited/updated to prevent truncation. `MangaCard.tsx` is truncated, so decimal-preserving rendering cannot be verified from the provided code excerpt.",
      "evidence": [
        "<file-diff> Modified files list does not include `frontend/src/utils/formatChapterNumber.ts`",
        "frontend/src/components/manga/MangaCard.tsx (truncated excerpt does not show chapter-progress display rendering)"

      "description": "Adjusted layout beyond requested arrow change (ArrowRight moved down 10px and rating UI shifted up 10px / horizontal star+number layout).",
      "reason": "The BuildRequest only asked to move the ArrowRight icon down by 5px while keeping the rest of the gutter layout behavior unchanged; shifting rating placement/layout is not requested and may violate 'keeping layout unchanged'.",
      "evidence": [
        "frontend-file-summaries.txt (describes MangaCard.tsx as 'ArrowRight ... moved down 10px' and 'rating UI ... shifted up 10px' and 'star + number side-by-side')"
