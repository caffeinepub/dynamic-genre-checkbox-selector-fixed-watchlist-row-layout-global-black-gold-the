  "summary": "REQ-2 appears implemented via an added in-repo manual regression checklist markdown. REQ-1 (dialog internal scrolling + reachable action buttons on small viewports) is suggested by the updated AddMangaDialog imports and the repo’s file summary, but the provided AddMangaDialog.tsx diff is truncated before any layout/container JSX changes are shown, so full compliance can’t be conclusively verified from the diff excerpt alone.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Ensure the “Add Manga” dialog’s form content is scrollable within the dialog viewport so that the bottom action buttons (“Cancel” and “Add Manga”) are always reachable on all common screen sizes, without dialog content overflowing off-screen.",
      "reason": "The AddMangaDialog.tsx diff excerpt is truncated before the JSX/layout section where max-height constraints, flex/min-h-0 composition, ScrollArea placement, and footer positioning would be implemented. The snippet only shows imports (including ScrollArea) and form/submit logic, which is insufficient to verify the required scroll/viewport behavior.",
