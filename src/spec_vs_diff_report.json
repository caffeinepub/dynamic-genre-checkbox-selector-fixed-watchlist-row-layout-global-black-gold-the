The diff summary does not provide enough concrete evidence to verify the required 25px upward shift/overlap behavior for the title-cycle arrow in MangaCard (REQ-1) or in CoverHoverPopup (REQ-2). An unrelated footer message/link appears to have been introduced.",

    {
      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Move the green \"cycle title\" arrow control up by 25px and allow it to visually overlap the rating area without pushing/repositioning the rating UI; both arrow and rating remain usable.",
      "reason": "The provided MangaCard.tsx diff content is truncated before any arrow positioning/z-index/transform changes are shown, so the exact 25px shift, overlap layering, and non-reflow constraints cannot be verified from the diff summary alone.",

      "requirement": "In CoverHoverPopup, shift the green ChevronRight title-cycle button upward by 25px with overlap via layering and without reflow; cycling titles should still work and not close the popup.",
      "reason": "The provided CoverHoverPopup.tsx diff content is truncated before any ChevronRight button positioning/z-index/transform changes are shown, so the 25px shift/overlap and behavior constraints cannot be verified from the diff summary alone.",
